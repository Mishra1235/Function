        "    - In Python, functions and methods are similar because both are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called using parentheses. However, they differ mainly in where they are defined and how they are used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function:\n",
        "A function is independent and defined using the def keyword at the top level (not inside a class).\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be called on its own, not tied to any object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "\n",
        "Method:\n",
        "A method is a function that is associated with an object (usually defined inside a class).\n",
        "\n",
        "It always takes self as the first parameter if it is an instance method.\n",

        "Has __iter__() → returns itself\n",

        "This function doesn’t execute immediately — it returns a generator object that produces values on demand.\n",

        " 1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Generators do not store all values in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "They generate each value on the fly, which saves memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "Regular functions that return a list must finish all computations before returning.\n",
        "\n",

        " 4. Cleaner Code for Iteration\n",

        "\n",
